This project was chosen because it utilizes most of the skills that we learned from other assignments.  The assignment involves creating a server and a chat client to create a chat room application in Java. The servers listen to a specified port for users who are connecting to the chat room. The client can use their own username and can send message to the chatroom or directly message another user.

This project helped to attain a system level understanding of the computer and to demonstrate self-awareness, understanding of effecting group dynamics, and project management skills. The project involved collaboration of around 20 students each contributing to come up with a specific protocol. After, working as a big team, students in the team were divided in to groups of two, so that way each group can implement the application in their own way using the protocol. Which means that one application can work with a different groupâ€™s application because both has the same protocol. This helped me to understand the effective of group dynamics and project management skills. Since, the project involves implementing a server and a client using Socket.IO, it demonstrates how a computer program interacts with a network. Also, both are multithreaded, it shows the relationship between the various levels in a computer system because the application can handle multiple requests using threads.
